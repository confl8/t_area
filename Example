The following shows and example python script that computes the area of a circle. The area of a circle is given by the formula area = pi * radius squared

 

# assign the value 3.14 to the variable pi 
pi = 3.14 

# assign the value 8 to the variable radius 
radius = 8 

# assign the results of the operation to the variable area 
# the operation multiplies radius by radius and then multiplies the result by 

# the value of pi 
area = pi * (radius * radius) 

# print the value of area 
print(area)
